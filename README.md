# Overview

This is my implementation of a simple HTTP Server. This project hopes to be able to handle HTTP Request dynamically and send an appropriate HTTP response.

# Objective

This project will explore the following areas:
- Socket I/O
- HTTP (Overall Protocol)
- Static File 
- Evented I/O + Zero Copy File Serving
- Caching

# Tech Stack

I am mainly using using C and Linux to explore the low-level innerworkings of an HTTP Server.

# Usage

To build the server:

```bash
make
```

To run the server:
```bash
./Build/server
```
